## A small webpage with some selected projects and resources

#### You can access some of my projects and created resources here

The website is hosted [here](https://sayarghoshroy.github.io/).

---

The site was built using Jekyll upon the theme [Alembic](https://github.com/daviddarnes/alembic).

My design features a landing page, a projects showcase page and a tab to hold your resume.

The style can be easily tweaked by editting the files:
- `_sass/_settings.scss` 
- `_sass/_theme.scss`

#### To Build

```bash
bundle update
bundle install
```

#### To Run Locally

1. Open `Gemfile` in a text editor
2. Uncomment line 17 i.e add `gemspec`
3. In line 4, modify `github-pages` to `jekyll-remote-theme`
4. Build using `bundle`
5. Fire up the terminal and run: `bundle exec jekyll serve`
